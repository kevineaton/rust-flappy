# Flappy (In Rust!)

This repo is for learning purposes only as I follow along in Hands-on Rust. It's not meant as anything other than a place for me to learn (and store) my follow-along code for the book.

As a Go developer most of the time, Rust seems like an interesting language for lower-level coding. It's something I am interested in, working in IoT.
